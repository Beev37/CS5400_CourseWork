Chpt. 1: (1.1-1.5)

 Exercise  1.1 Which of the following sequences of characters are atoms, which are variables, and which are neither?

    vINCENT                 - atom
    Footmassage             - variable 
    variable23              - atom
    Variable2000            - variable
    big_kahuna_burger       - atom
    ’big  kahuna  burger’   - atom
    big  kahuna  burger     - neither
    ’Jules’                 - atom
    _Jules                  - variable
    ’_Jules’                - atom

Exercise  1.2 Which of the following sequences of characters are atoms, which are variables, which are complex terms, and which are not terms at all? 
Give the functor and arity of each complex term.

    loves(Vincent,mia)                  - complex term [functor=loves; arity=2]
    ’loves(Vincent,mia)’                - atom
    Butch(boxer)                        - neither (because the functor is not a valid atom)
    boxer(Butch)                        - complex term [functor=boxer; arity=1]
    and(big(burger),kahuna(burger))     - complex term [functor=and; arity=2]
    and(big(X),kahuna(X))               - complex term [functor=and; arity=2]
    _and(big(X),kahuna(X))              - neither (because the functor is not a valid atom)
    (Butch  kills  Vincent)             - neither (because of the lack of a functor)
    kills(Butch  Vincent)               - neither (because the lack of a comma separating the arguments)
    kills(Butch,Vincent                 - neither (because of the typo [forgetting the closing parentheses])

Exercise  1.3 How many facts, rules, clauses, and predicates are there in the following knowledge base? 
What are the heads of the rules, and what are the goals they contain?

   woman(vincent).                          -
   woman(mia).
   man(jules).
   person(X):-  man(X);  woman(X).
   loves(X,Y):-  father(X,Y).
   father(Y,Z):-  man(Y),  son(Z,Y).
   father(Y,Z):-  man(Y),  daughter(Z,Y).

Exercise  1.4 Represent the following in Prolog:

    Butch is a killer.
    Mia and Marsellus are married.
    Zed is dead.
    Marsellus kills everyone who gives Mia a footmassage.
    Mia loves everyone who is a good dancer.
    Jules eats anything that is nutritious or tasty.

Exercise  1.5 Suppose we are working with the following knowledge base:

   wizard(ron).
   hasWand(harry).
   quidditchPlayer(harry).
   wizard(X):-  hasBroom(X),  hasWand(X).
   hasBroom(X):-  quidditchPlayer(X).

How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

    wizard(ron).
    witch(ron).
    wizard(hermione).
    witch(hermione).
    wizard(harry).
    wizard(Y).
    witch(Y).
