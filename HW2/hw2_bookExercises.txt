 Exercise  2.3 Here is a tiny lexicon (that is, information about individual words) and a mini grammar consisting of one syntactic rule (which defines a sentence to be an entity consisting of five words in the following order: a determiner, a noun, a verb, a determiner, a noun).

   word(determiner,a).
   word(determiner,every).
   word(noun,criminal).
   word(noun,’big  kahuna  burger’).
   word(verb,eats).
   word(verb,likes).
   
   sentence(Word1,Word2,Word3,Word4,Word5):-
         word(determiner,Word1),
         word(noun,Word2),
         word(verb,Word3),
         word(determiner,Word4),
         word(noun,Word5).

What query do you have to pose in order to find out which sentences the grammar can generate? List all sentences that this grammar can generate in the order that Prolog will generate them in.

    Answer: (There appear to be 32 unique combinations that prolog finds given the KB - and some are hilarious - namely 19 and 22)

1) “a criminal eats a criminal”
A = D, D = a,
B = E, E = criminal,

Exercise  2.4 Here are six Italian words:

astante , astoria , baratto , cobalto , pistola , statale .

They are to be arranged, crossword puzzle fashion, in the following grid: 

[grid shown at: http://www.let.rug.nl/bos/lpn//lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse7]

 The following knowledge base represents a lexicon containing these words:
   word(astante,  a,s,t,a,n,t,e).
   word(astoria,  a,s,t,o,r,i,a).
   word(baratto,  b,a,r,a,t,t,o).
   word(cobalto,  c,o,b,a,l,t,o).
   word(pistola,  p,i,s,t,o,l,a).
   word(statale,  s,t,a,t,a,l,e).

Write a predicate crossword/6 that tells us how to fill in the grid. The first three arguments should be the vertical words from left to right, and the last three arguments the horizontal words from top to bottom.
